## Features
- **Multi-disease Prediction**: Includes models for heart disease, diabetes, and other conditions.
- **Interactive Interface**: Input health parameters via a simple and user-friendly web interface.
- **Real-Time Results**: Provides immediate predictions based on the provided inputs.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for building an interactive web application.
- **Backend**: Pre-trained machine learning models using Scikit-learn.
- **Data Processing**: Python, Pandas, and Numpy for cleaning and preparing datasets.
